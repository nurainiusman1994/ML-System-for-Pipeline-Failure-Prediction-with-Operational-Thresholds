# Pipeline Failure Risk Prediction

This project aims to predict the condition (Normal, Moderate, Critical) of oil and gas pipeline segments using machine learning. It utilizes historical operational data including physical dimensions, material properties, pressure, temperature, corrosion impact, and time in service.

## Data

The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from Kaggle: [Predictive Maintenance Oil and Gas Pipeline Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadwaqas023/predictive-maintenance-oil-and-gas-pipeline-data/data).

## Project Steps

The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

1.  **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**
    *   Loading the dataset.
    *   Handling missing values (imputation with median).
    *   Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including visualizing feature distributions and relationships (pairplots, histograms, countplots).
    *   Creating new features (e.g., `PRESSURE_TEMP_PRODUCT`, `THICKNESS_RATIO`, `ANNUAL_LOSS_RATE`).
    *   Defining preprocessing steps for numerical and categorical features using `ColumnTransformer` (RobustScaler for numerical, OneHotEncoder for categorical).
    *   Analyzing feature correlations.
    *   Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2.  **Model Training & Evaluation:**
    *   Training various classification models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, ANN, Naive Bayes) using scikit-learn pipelines.
    *   Evaluating models based on `classification_report` and `f1_score`.

3.  **Optimal Model Selection (Gradient Boosting):**
    *   Selecting Gradient Boosting as the optimal model based on initial evaluation.
    *   Performing hyperparameter tuning for Gradient Boosting using `GridSearchCV` to find the best parameters and improve performance.
    *   (Also included tuning for Decision Tree for comparison/interpretability purposes).

4.  **Critical Threshold Identification:**
    *   Analyzing the data for 'Critical' condition instances to identify operational thresholds for key features (Temperature, Pressure, Thickness Loss, Annual Loss Rate, Corrosion Impact). These are typically derived from high percentiles (e.g., 90th or 95th percentile) of the 'Critical' data.

5.  **Decision Rules Extraction:**
    *   Training an interpretable model (Decision Tree with limited depth) to extract human-readable rules that provide insights into the classification logic.
    *   Analyzing material-specific safe limits based on historical data.

6.  **Model Deployment (Streamlit App):**
    *   Saving the trained Gradient Boosting pipeline and identified critical thresholds.
    *   Creating a simple Streamlit web application (`app.py`) that takes pipeline parameters as input, performs necessary preprocessing and feature engineering, makes a prediction using the saved model, and provides alerts if input parameters exceed the identified critical thresholds.

## Files

*   `pipeline_thickness_model.pkl`: The trained scikit-learn pipeline object (including preprocessing and the Gradient Boosting model).
*   `operational_thresholds.json`: A JSON file containing the identified critical operational thresholds.
*   `app.py`: The Streamlit script for the web application.
*   `market_pipe_thickness_loss_dataset.csv`: The input dataset (expected in the environment where the notebook or script is run, or specify the path).

## How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Ensure you have Python installed.
    *   Install necessary libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `streamlit`, `joblib`. You can install them using pip:
